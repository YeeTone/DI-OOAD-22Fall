## What you can and what you cannot
You can:
- Work on an assignment with a friend, and think together about the program structure, share ideas and even the global logic. At the time of actually writing the code, you should write it alone.
- Use in an assignment a piece of code found on the web, as long as you indicate in a comment where it was found and don't claim it as your own work.
- Help friends debug their programs
- Show your code to friends to explain the logic, as long as the friends write their code on their own later

You cannot:
- Take the code of a friend and make a few cosmetic changes and pass it as your own work

## Warning!
1. Don't try to plagiarize, and we ensure we will launch duplication checking programs for your submission after deadline
2. If you fork this repository, considering the forked repository cannot be private, do not push any of your code before the deadline.
